He specialized in data for economic policies, poverty reduction, financial inclusion, and rural development.
His role at DIAL is to support the expansion of the Catalog of Digital Solutions and the Digital Principles. Since he entered in March 2022, Mateus has been helping mainly with the open data, playbooks, organizations and products tabs of the Catalog, and on data about the Digital Principles endorsers and the new intake form for potential endorsers. Mateus comes to DIAL with experience in international contexts and multilateral organizations, such as a field research coordinator at USP, Jr Technical Officer at ILO, and data intern at ENPARD, UNDP Georgia’s rural development program. His formation, with an Erasmus Joint Master Degree, was complemented by internships and voluntary experiences across Brazil in the areas of financial democratization, education, and slums development, currently coordinating a voluntary community team in a slum in Duque de Caxias (RJ).

#### Data Exploration and Visualization

#### Dashboarding with Data

#### Introduction to Machine Learning

#### Introduction to Optimization

#### Deep Learning Fundamentals

- Session description 

The terms deep learning and neural network are used almost interchangeably in AI. There has also been a great deal of hype and mystery around these terms, and this session aims to demystify deep learning so that you have a sense of what deep learning and neural networks really are.

Furthermore, by providing a walkthrough using real-world examples where deep learning yielded immense success we will see how to use it as a data scientist working on social good projects.

- Learning Goals

Appreciate the value deep learning adds to the machine learning suite

Why deep learning works so well, and what are some pre-requisites for it to work well

Awareness of toolkits and resources to get up to speed in application of deep learning

### Week 4

#### Text Mining Specialization

##### Learning to Speak Data

- Session description

Communicating with data can feel like a different language; using numbers and charts invokes a unique power and impact. With more and more decision-making processes centering on data, we need creative new ways for building our data literacy. This session will help you learn that language in fun ways. You’ll walk away with experience moving from data to story, deeper critical understanding of the power of data in communication, and knowledge of tools to help others learn alongside you in your organizations.

##### Privacy-aware Personalization using Text Embeddings

- Session description

In this session we will introduce key approaches for personalization and will have a deep dive on text document recommendations, which is key in many use cases such as news recommendation and content discovery on the web. We will focus on specific personalization approaches that preserve user privacy, that is, algorithms that do not require any personal identifiable information.

##### Managing Medium Sized Datasets without Making your Brain Melt

- Session description

Small datasets can usually be loaded entirely into memory, even on commodity hardware, and working with very large datasets usually calls for distributed computation approaches. Somewhere in the middle however, are cases where there is too much to work with on a single machine, but a distributed approach isn't justified with cost or complexity. This tutorial explores tricks and techniques for working with this kind of "medium" sized data, that's too big to trivially process, but not big enough to warrant a more complex deployment.

### Week 6

#### Stakeholder Communication

- Session description 

How do you get people to support your data science solution? And how do you ensure that decision makers can use the insights that come from your data? Effective communication can help you to get management, colleagues and other stakeholders on board with your data science project. In this session, you will learn the most important practices in engaging your stakeholders and apply this to your own data science project.
